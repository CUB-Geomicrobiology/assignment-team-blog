# Winogradsky Column Blog

The big team assignment for the semester is to follow the development of your Winogradsky columns and describe how they are doing every ~3 weeks. This should include some sort of results and discussion sections as mentioned in the individual `entry?.md` files as well as images (photographs or sketches) that illustrate the developments.

## Setup

When your team first starts this assignment, there is a small bit of setup required:

1. Edit the [`_config.yml`](_config.yml) file to update the `blogtitle` (be creative, this is the name of your blog) and `baseurl` (this is simply the name of this repository which should be something along the lines of `blog-your-team-name`).
2. Now your blog should be available at `https://2017-geomicrobiology.github.io/blog-your-team-name` (with the last part the `baseurl` you just entered).
3. Note that the main branch for this assignment is `gh-pages` instead of `master`, this is because we want your blog to be visible as a website. You can still use branches as much as you like when you work on this as a team, just merge individual branches into `gh-pages` instead of `master` (revisit the [Intro Team Video tutorial for a refresher on branches](https://youtu.be/k2NjjQxFEuA)).
4. Note that updates to the `.md` file may take 30-60s to become visible at the website address for your team (this is because the website is re-generated automatically after every commit) and will always reflect the `gh-pages` branch.

## Assignment

1. For each entry (1-4), edit the corresponding `entry?.md` file to write about the development of your Winogradsky columns (coordinate with your team and/or work in branches to work together).
2. Add any images you might want to use to the [`images` folder](images) (follow the images [`README`](images/README.md) for a refresher).
3. Whenever a blog entry is due, submit the `gh-pages` branch to the `submit` branch.

If you are unsure how to work this assignment, please re-watch the video tutorial for the very first assignment. This is an individual assignment so you should complete the writing by yourself but you are encouraged to bounce ideas off your teammates. If you do get stuck with any of the technical aspects surrounding the assignment (access, editing, submission, etc.), see if one of your teammates can help you. If all else fails, please email the instructor for help.

## Submission

Once you have completed a blog entry, submit by creating a pull request with `submit` as the base branch (`gh-pages` as **compare**) and your instructor as the reviewer.

## Grading

Each entry will be graded based on the setup (entry1) / results (entries 2-4) and discussion sections, as well as overall formatting which includes appropriate images and cleanup of the assignments.
