> Report on the changes in your Winogradsky columns. Include images if they help illustrate a point.

## Results

> What happened over the past weeks? Consider for example:
 - What colors appeared?
 - Where in the columns do they appear?
 - How do the columns look different from one another?
 - Are there any worms, snails or other larger organisms in the columns?

> How would you interpret the changes? Consider for example:
 - What do the results have to do with what was added (or not added) to the columns?
 - Which kind of organisms/metabolisms do you think are playing a role?

## Conclusion

> For the last entry, consider also how the different conditions have developed overall. Did they behave as you expected? Did they turn out differently? How would you expect them to develop from here on out?
